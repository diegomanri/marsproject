marsproject
===========

MARS which stands for Management Assistant and Recording System is a Java application that interacts with our client's database to add/update/delete records.
Database information will then be used to produce reports.

To contribute in this project you must use the same Package, Classes, and Methods names in your computer so that we don't have to change those names back and forth.
